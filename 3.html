<h2 class="dot">Software - Introduction:</h2>
<p>
As we know stand alone hardware cannot do nothing, for the smooth operation of our Computer System there should be proper coordination between hardware and software. Software helps to mobilize the hardware and other  resources. In order to mobilize hardware we have to write several set of instruction which instruct computer  what to do, what not o. These set of instruction are collectively know as program and the term software is the collection of related programs and  associated documents. In Order to produce useful output, hardware and software must work together. Nothing useful can be done with the hardware only and software cannot be utilize without hardware. The different types of software are:
</p>
<h2>1) System software:</h2><p> System software is set of one or more programs designed to control the operation of our computer system. This type of software doesn't fulfill the specific requirement of the user. They are general program written to assist human in the use of the computer system. In general system software support the running of other software, communicate with peripheral device, support the development of other types of software and monitors the use of various hardware resources. Thus, the system software makes the operation of the computer system more effective and efficient. The system software is categorized into two categories.</p>

<h3>1.1) System Management:</h3> It is responsible for proper management and functioning of the computers system. All types of management between computer hardware and software is performed by system management software. There are 3 types of system management software:

<h4>1.1.1) Operating System:</h4> Operating system is a collection program that controls the overall operation of the computer system. It is the 1st program that is loaded into memory when the computer is turned on. It provides platform for other application program to run and execute. It provides user with an interface so that uses can easily communicate with computer. For example Linux, Windows, Mac etc

<h4>1.1.2) Utility software:</h4> It is the supporting software which is used to perform specific task related to the maintenance of the computer system. Some  of the utility software are included in operating system where as some are available as separate utility in market. They are also called service program. For example  Norton Utility, PC tools, win zip etc

<h4>1.1.3) Device driver:</h4> A device driver is a software which is responsible for smooth functioning of the hardware device that is connected to the computer. When we add a new  device to the computer, we need to install new software called device driver. Device driver will co-ordinate with the operating system and the newly installed hardware functions properly and smoothly.

<h3>1.2) System Development:</h3> It refers to set of programs that are use to develop computer program. This type of software are not used by a normal user of the computes. They are used by programmers for the development of new program. There are two types of system development software:

<h4>1.2.1) Programming language:</h4> The language with which we give instruction to the computer is known as programming language. Programming language are the set of different keywords, variable, operators, loops and other symbols etc. They help to make communication between computer and user. These are two types of programming language low level language and high level language.

<h4>1.2.2) Language translator:</h4> It is a special kind computer software which translates the programs written one language in another language. It is compulsory for both low and high level language. It is also called language processor. The types of language translator are compiler, interpreter  and assembler.


<h2>2) Application Software</h2>
  <p>Application software is a set of one or more programs designed to do a specific task. It is made to fulfill the user demand. This program directs a computer to solve user-oriented problems such as preparing bills, calculating mathematical equations, preparing mark sheets, etc. The software that is developed for user purposes is called application software. These types of software are generally developed by using high-level languages. Examples include MS-Excel, Photoshop, Billing software, etc.</p>
  <p>There are two types of application software:</p>
  
  <h3>2.1) Packaged Software</h3>
  <p>Packaged software is a generalized set of programs designed and developed for general purposes. It is generally large-sized, error-free, advanced, and standard software with much more functionality for special work. This type of software doesn't perfectly match the requirements of many organizations or users. They cannot be changed easily and are developed and designed by reputed software companies, so they are trustworthy. However, they are expensive for small organizations. Examples include MS-Office, Adobe, Macromedia, etc.</p>
  
  <h3>2.2) Customized/Tailored Software</h3>
  <p>Customized or tailored software is developed in a high-level language for special tasks. This type of software is developed for a specific purpose to solve the specific problems of a particular user or organization. The requirements of the user or organization can be perfectly matched. They can be changed easily since they are made by local programmers. Examples include payroll systems, inventory management, school management, billing software, mark sheet evaluation, etc.</p>

 <h2>oerating System - Introduction</h2>
    <p>An operating system (OS) is an integrated set of programs that controls overall resources such as CPU, memory, input-output devices of the computer system. The major objective of the operating system is to improve the performance and efficiency of a computer system. Like the manager of a company, an operating system is responsible for the smooth and efficient functioning of the entire computer system. The operating system provides the platform for other application programs/software to run and execute. It provides the user with an interface so that the user can easily communicate with computers, which is more convenient to use and operate.</p>
    
    <p>An operating system is a collection of programs that controls the overall operation of the computer system. It also controls and coordinates the use of hardware, among the various application programs for various users. So, it acts as an interface between the user and the computer hardware. The other major functions of an operating system are:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>It controls, monitors, and coordinates the overall operation of our computer system.</li>
        <li>It acts as an interface between the user and the computer.</li>
        <li>It provides a platform to develop, run, and execute other computer programs.</li>
        <li>It manages hardware resources such as CPU, memories, input-output terminals, networking equipment, etc.</li>
        <li>It hides programming and hardware complexity from the user.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>The primary goal of an operating system is to maximize the productivity of a computer system by operating it in the most efficient manner and maintaining the amount of human intervention. Some examples of operating systems are: MS-DOS, Windows, Linux, macOS, UNIX, Chrome, Fedora, Ubuntu, etc.</p>
</p>
 <h2>unctions / Features / Advantages of Operating System (OS)</h2>
    <p><strong>1) Input-Output (I/O) Management:</strong> Input-Output is essential to operate any computer. It allows the computer to interact with several peripheral devices such as keyboard, mouse, printer, scanner, etc.</p>

    <p><strong>2) User Interface (UI):</strong> User Interface means an ideal environment in which the user can work on it so that they can interact with the computerized system. Every operating system provides the feature of user interface to enhance the experience and joy of using a computer or any other computerized system. It acts as a bridge between the user and the computer. There are 2 types of user interfaces:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Character/Command User Interface (CUI):</strong> Example: MS-DOS</li>
        <li><strong>Graphical User Interface (GUI):</strong> Example: Windows, macOS</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>3) Security:</strong> The operating system of a computer has several built-in tools to protect against security threats such as viruses, unauthorized access, suspicious network activity, etc. The basic security in an OS is to control access to the computer by setting users and passwords.</p>

    <p><strong>4) Process Management:</strong> The process management allocates a processor to execute a chosen process. The OS acts as a traffic controller, job scheduler, process scheduler, and dispatcher.</p>

    <p><strong>5) Memory Management:</strong> Memory is a large array of bytes, each with its own address. When the user requests the CPU for a read-write operation, the OS determines the amount of memory required for the program instructions and data. The OS then allocates the required memory to load the program and data into RAM. When the program terminates, it frees up the space and loads a new program.</p>

    <p><strong>6) Data Management:</strong> Data management allows organizing data into logical groupings called files. Earlier, operating systems did not provide data management features, making them inflexible. However, modern operating systems provide this feature.</p>

    <p><strong>7) Command Interpreter:</strong> The command interpreter reads the commands that a user types at a terminal, interprets them, and translates them into a detailed set of instructions that the computer hardware can understand. Every operating system must have a command interpreter for its operation.</p>

    <p><strong>8) Deadlock Prevention:</strong> During processing, a situation can arise where a resource shared by two or more processes cannot continue because the resource required by one process is held by another. This situation is known as a deadlock. For example, if process-1 allocates resource A and later requires resource B, and process-2 allocates resource B and later requires resource A, neither process-1 nor process-2 will be executed. The operating system ensures deadlock prevention by taking actions such as careful allocation of resources.</p>

    <p><strong>9) Time Sharing:</strong> Time sharing is a function of the OS that involves allocating CPU time to a number of users on the same computer. This property is generally found in network operating systems such as Windows NT.</p>

    <p><strong>10) Virtual Memory:</strong> Virtual memory is a feature of the operating system that allows a computer to compensate for a shortage of physical memory by transferring temporary files from RAM to disk. Virtual memory has twice as many addresses as main memory. The process of translating virtual addresses into real addresses is known as mapping. The copying of virtual pages from disk to main memory is known as swapping.</p>
