        <h2>What is Multimedia?</h2>
        <p>Multimedia consists of two words: ‘Multi’ and ‘Media’. 'Multi' means many and 'Media' refers to the medium of expressing information. Hence, multimedia is the way of expressing information in different forms, such as text, audio, video, graphics, and animation. We use several forms of media for better understanding and effective communication. By using multimedia, any information can be illustrated in greater depth.</p>
        <p>Since a single form of media is inefficient for better communication and understanding, we integrate several components of multimedia (text, audio, video, animation, and graphics) by using a multimedia computer system. The integration of different forms of media is mandatory for effective communication. Multimedia computer systems consist of both multimedia hardware and multimedia software.</p>
        <p>Some of the widely used multimedia computer hardware include printers, projectors, webcams, microphones, digital cameras, etc. Similarly, software like text editors (MS Word), presentation tools (PowerPoint), photo editing software (Photoshop), video editing software (iMovie), and accounting software (Tally) are used as multimedia software. These hardware and software work together to integrate various multimedia components. For example, a video can be created by integrating audio and images.</p>

        <h2>Components/Elements of Multimedia</h2>
        <h3>Text</h3>
        <p>Text refers to the collection of alphanumeric characters or any written content. It can be a word, sentence, or paragraph. Text can be customized in terms of size, color, type, and style using various text editors such as MS Word or Notepad. Text documents generally have extensions like <code>.docx</code>, <code>.txt</code>, etc.</p>

        <h3>Graphics / Images</h3>
        <p>Graphics refer to images or pictures that can convey more information than text. The smallest element of a picture is called a pixel, and the quality of an image is determined by the number of pixels (resolution). Popular multimedia software like Adobe Photoshop, CorelDRAW, and Adobe InDesign are used for image editing. Image files usually have extensions like <code>.jpeg</code>, <code>.png</code>, etc.</p>

        <h3>Audio</h3>
        <p>Audio is one of the most important components of multimedia. It provides the sensation of hearing and can be used to enhance understanding of topics. Audio can include human voices, instrument notes, natural sounds, and digitally synthesized sounds. FM radio, for example, uses audio to communicate information. Common audio extensions include <code>.mp3</code>, <code>.wma</code>, etc.</p>

        <h3>Video</h3>
        <p>Video is a sequence of static images (frames) that are played rapidly to create the illusion of movement. Frame rate (FPS) refers to the number of frames displayed per second. Typically, 15-25 FPS is used to generate smooth motion in videos, but higher rates like 30 and 60 FPS are used in modern devices. Video files generally have extensions like <code>.mp4</code>, <code>.mpeg</code>, etc.</p>

        <h3>Animation</h3>
        <p>Animation consists of a sequence of computer-generated images that are shown in rapid succession to create visual effects. Animations can be 2D or 3D, with 3D animation being more realistic. Movies and entertainment industries use animations to represent complex concepts or ideas that are difficult to portray in real life. Software like Maya, AutoCAD, and Flash are used for animation creation. Animation files typically have extensions like <code>.flv</code>, <code>.gif</code>, etc.</p>
