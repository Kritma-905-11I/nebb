 <h2>Introduction to HTML</h2>
    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is used to create web pages that are used on the internet to exchange data and information. An HTML file itself is a text file that contains several tags and attributes. HTML was developed by Tim Berners-Lee and is based on SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language). The tags and attributes used to create an HTML file are displayed using a web browser. Web browsers help understand all the tags and attributes given by the user and generate the content of the page. The different versions of HTML are: HTML, HTML+, HTML 1.0, HTML 2.0, HTML 3.2, HTML 4.01, and now HTML 5.0.</p>

    <h3>Use of HTML</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It is used to create a basic layout or design of a web page.</li>
        <li>Without HTML, the worldwide web wouldn't exist.</li>
        <li>It allows features like embedding images, videos, and audio.</li>
        <li>It allows users to customize and format characters, such as bold, italic, and underline.</li>
        <li>It helps create links and lists.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Advantages of HTML</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It is easy to use, flexible, and user-friendly.</li>
        <li>It is supported by all web browsers and operating systems, such as Macintosh, Windows, and Unix.</li>
        <li>It is easier to obtain and modify any content.</li>
        <li>It is compatible with all search engines.</li>
        <li>There are several new and advanced features in HTML 5.0.</li>
        <li>HTML files take a short period of time to load.</li>
        <li>Several tutorials can be easily accessed regarding HTML.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages of HTML</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It is difficult to create attractive and interactive web pages using only HTML (PHP, JavaScript, SQL, etc. are needed).</li>
        <li>It cannot be used to create dynamic web pages.</li>
        <li>It is only a scripting language and cannot be used as a programming language.</li>
        <li>There are many incompatibilities in HTML.</li>
        <li>There is no complete and universally accepted standard of HTML.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Tags</h3>
    <p>HTML tags are the instructions or commands given to the web browser in order to organize text, images, and any other components of web pages. These HTML tags are executed by the web browser accordingly. Like any programming language, HTML tags also help to perform specific actions. HTML tags are written inside angular brackets &lt;&gt;. There are two types of HTML tags:</p>
 <h2>HTML Tags and Attributes</h2>
    <h3>Pair Tags</h3>
    <p>Pair tags are those which have both opening and closing tags. These are also known as container tags. If a tag is written only within angular brackets &lt;&gt;, it is the opening tag. The same tag, preceded by a slash (/) within angular brackets, is the closing tag.</p>

    <h3>Singular Tags</h3>
    <p>Singular tags are those that have only an opening tag but no closing tag. They are also known as empty tags.</p>

    <h3>Attributes</h3>
    <p>Attributes are descriptive properties of HTML tags written within the respective tag. They help to add extra features and allow the designer to customize and modify several components of web pages according to the requirement.</p>
    <p>For example, for the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag, some common attributes are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><code>bgcolor</code> – Helps to add a background color.</li>
        <li><code>text</code> – Changes the color of the text in the webpage.</li>
        <li><code>background</code> – Adds an image in the background of the webpage.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps to Write and Execute an HTML Document</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Write all the HTML tags, attributes, and related information in a notepad.</li>
        <li>Save your document using the desired name followed by the <code>.html</code> extension (e.g., <code>sample.html</code>).</li>
        <li>Execute the HTML file by using any web browser.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Some Common Terminologies in Web Designing</h2>

    <h3>Webpage</h3>
    <p>A webpage is generally an HTML document or written in any other scripting language that helps to execute information in the form of text, images, or other components through the internet.</p>

    <h3>Website</h3>
    <p>A website is a collection of interrelated webpages. It may contain any piece of information or may have information that is interrelated with several webpages connected through hyperlinks. A website has two parts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Domain Name:</b> The name used to access the website.</li>
        <li><b>Web Server:</b> The storage location where all information associated with a website is stored.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Home Page</h3>
    <p>The home page is the introductory page that is displayed first when we access the website.</p>

    <h3>Web Browser</h3>
    <p>A web browser is an application program that helps to access any content of webpages, which may be in any form using the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). This protocol helps make communication between the web browser and web server. Examples include Google Chrome, Internet Explorer (Microsoft Edge), Safari, Mozilla Firefox, Netscape Navigator, etc.</p>

    <h3>URL</h3>
    <p>URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a standard way of referencing a protocol, host, and a directory. For example: <code>https://readersnepal.com</code>.</p>

    <h2>DBMS (Database Management System)</h2>

    <h3>Data and Information</h3>
    <p><b>Data:</b> Data are the raw facts and figures. Data are isolated, uninterpreted, and don't provide any meaning unless processed. For example, Ram, 19, 12, Pokhara.</p>
    <p><b>Information:</b> Information is the meaningful result obtained after processing data. It is generally a processed version of data. For example, "Ram is a student whose age is 19, and he lives in Pokhara-12."</p>

    <h3>Database</h3>
    <p>A database is a systematically organized collection of data that allows retrieval of information quickly and easily. It converts data into meaningful information. For example, a dictionary, mark ledger, census, and telephone directory are databases.</p>

    <h3>DBMS (Database Management System)</h3>
    <p>A DBMS is a software system that helps to maintain a database. It allows systematic and scientific organization and collection of data so that information can be retrieved quickly. Examples include MS Access, MySQL, Oracle, FoxPro, and dBase.</p>

    <h3>Advantages/Features/Importance of DBMS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>It allows users to search data quickly and easily.</li>
        <li>It helps reduce data redundancy (repetition).</li>
        <li>It allows users to share data over a network.</li>
        <li>It helps in data security and privacy.</li>
        <li>It improves data consistency.</li>
        <li>It provides an organized way of storing data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Disadvantages of DBMS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Installation and operating costs are higher.</li>
        <li>It requires more disk space.</li>
        <li>It may sometimes have security and privacy issues.</li>
        <li>Technical manpower (DBA) is required to maintain and operate the system.</li>
    </ul>
