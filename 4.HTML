<h2>MS-Excel (Spreadsheet)</h2>
MS-Excel is a spreadsheet software in the Microsoft office suite that allows user to store, organize and analyze numerical and text data. It is a part of MS-Office package. A spreadsheet program allows to present information in a clear way. It can be use to perform mathematical calculation using several mathematical formula and equations. Excel also allows us to convert spreadsheet data into various charts like bar-graph, columns and other. It can be use to calculate the data according to the need of the user such as salary sheet, income and expenses statement, balance sheet, budget preparation, grade and percentage calculation etc. Some application areas of excel are:
<ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Mathematical Calculation:</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Financial Modeling and Analysis:</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Statistical Analysis:</strong> .</li>
        <li><strong>Scientific and Engineering Calculation:</strong> </li>
        <li><strong>Graphic Presentation:</strong></li>
        <li><strong>File Extensions:</strong> The extension of MS-Excel files is “.xlsx” and “.xls”.</li>
    </ul>

<h2>Common terminologies used in spreadsheet.</h2>
<h5>Worksheet(Spreadsheet):</h5> Worksheet is the collection of rows and columns which are use to list, organize and calculate data.

<h5>Workbook:</h5> The files that are used in spreadsheet are collectively known as workbook. Workbook are made up of several numbers of worksheet. By default, one workbook have three worksheet.

<h5>Cell:</h5> The intersection of rows and columns are called cell. In order to refer a cell, enter a column letter followed by row number. For eg, C2 The cell where intersection point is called active cell.

<h2>Features of MS-Excel</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>It facilitates us to work in multiple worksheets at a time.</li>
        <li>It allows us to create different types of charts and graphs.</li>
        <li>It allows us to organize and manage large volumes of data.</li>
        <li>It allows us to perform any type of calculation automatically by using custom formulas and equations.</li>
        <li>It allows us to easily sort the data in ascending and descending order.</li>
        <li>It supports high-level features like object linking and embedding.</li>
        <li>It allows us to format data to make it more attractive by using tools like font size, font color, etc.</li>
        <li>Simple computing operations such as cut, copy, paste, find, and replace can be easily done.</li>
        <li>It includes internet features such as a web toolbar.</li>
        <li>It allows us to store data electronically in any storage medium.</li>
    </ol>

 <h2>Cell Reference in Excel (V. imp)</h2>
    <p>A cell location in a spreadsheet is referred to as its cell reference. To find a cell reference, simply look at the column heading to find which column the cell is in and across to find which row it is in. The cell reference is a combination of column letter and row number such as A1, B3, Z9. When writing a cell reference, the column letter should always come first.</p>
    <p>Cell reference is very important, especially when writing formulas or addressing the cell to evaluate it. For example, if we want to add values 3 and 2 which are in A1 and A2 respectively, instead of writing <code>A3=3+2</code>, we write <code>A3=A1+A2</code>.</p>

    <h3>Types of Cell Reference</h3>
    <h4>Relative Cell Reference</h4>
    <p>A relative cell reference identifies the location of the cell or group of cells. Cell references are used in formulas, functions, charts, and other Excel commands. By default, a spreadsheet cell reference is relative, meaning formulas and functions can be copied and pasted to other cells. A relative cell consists of a column letter and row number, intersecting at the cell location. Examples of relative cell references are A1, B4, G9, etc.</p>

    <h4>Absolute Cell Reference</h4>
    <p>An absolute cell reference identifies the location of a cell or group of cells with both the column letter and row number surrounded by dollar signs ($). Examples of absolute cell references are $A$2, $G$9, $Z$345, etc. An easy way to add the dollar sign is to click on the cell reference and then press the “F4” key from the keyboard. Absolute cell references are used when you want a cell reference to stay fixed on a specific cell, meaning that formulas and functions will not change when copied to other cells.</p>

    <h2>MS-PowerPoint (Presentation)</h2>
    <p>PowerPoint is the presentation software in the Microsoft Office suite. With PowerPoint, we can create dynamic and professional presentations by using predefined layouts, themes, and templates. PowerPoint includes all the features we need to produce professional-looking presentations. A PowerPoint presentation consists of a series of slides that contain information to communicate with our audience. This information can include text, images, graphs, charts, videos, audio, and more. Presentation software can be used as a supplement to older visual aid technologies such as pamphlets, handouts, posters, and chalkboards.</p>
    <p>The extension of PowerPoint files is “.ppt,” while later versions use “.pptx.” Other software alternatives to MS-PowerPoint include MagicPoint, Apple Keynote, IBM Lotus, and Harvard Graphics.</p>

    <h3>Features of MS-PowerPoint</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Formatting of data helps to make documents much more attractive, effective, and interactive by using tools like font, font color, hyperlinks, etc.</li>
        <li>Simple computing operations such as cut, copy, paste, find, and replace are supported.</li>
        <li>It allows users to use pre-defined layouts, themes, and templates, helping in faster development and design of presentations.</li>
        <li>Slide transitions and effects can also be used for further requirements.</li>
        <li>We can create our own custom animations.</li>
        <li>It supports both internal and external hyperlinks.</li>
        <li>Different bars, graphs, and charts can be used to convey detailed and precise information.</li>
        <li>Internet features such as web toolbar, online help, and web linking can also be done.</li>
    </ul>
